# p5.js TypeScript and Ramda Starter Kit

The goal is to be able to quickly prototype in p5.js in the browser, but use modern tooling. This ideally would allow for inclusion of code is a similar codebase simply by migrating things over. Additionally, it is to explore a more functional approach with the processing / p5.js abstraction.

## Getting Started

### Installing

```
yarn
```

### Usage

```
yarn start
```

A local version will now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Changelog

- Added very strict typescript config
- Added packager via browserfy to allow in browser usage of modules
- Added Ramda functional library
